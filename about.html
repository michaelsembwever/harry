           	  <h4 class="padtop6-">My decision to run for Mayor is all about making a difference to the future direction of our beautiful region, to protect the history, the natural environment and our productive farmlands. Looking to the future we need a Council administration that is streamlined and is held accountable to a high performance standard and good governance. The Council managers and workforce need an environment in which they are given appropriate responsibilities and respect to do their jobs to the best of their abilities. Creating a sustainable future for our region is about having a Mayor and Council which actively seek new opportunities , encourage new business which give the region long term employment growth while protecting and enhancing the unique qualities of our region.</h4>

           	  <h2 class="padbot3">Biography</h2>
           	  <h4 class="p0">I am a 61 year old  Veterinary Surgeon. Born  in Sydney, NSW,  raised as a child in Hong Kong Japan  and Australia. My parents are Dutch, and are now in their 90s and  living  in NSW.  My veterinary studies were at  Sydney University,  and I also  did  post graduate diplomas in  Natural Resources  and  Dispute Resolution. I  have two adult children  and 3 granddaughters who have recently moved from Norway  where they were born.  I live in an old historic church in Milford just outside Boonah  which I run as a bed and breakfast accommodation and small function venue.</h4>
           	  <h4> I have worked in the veterinary industry for 38 years, mostly in small and large animal practice. In that time  I have  established three seperate Veterinary practices in Sydney, in Bowral (NSW) and  more recently in Boonah (Walter St Veterinary Clinic).  In the 1990s I spent 5 years  working for the NSW Veterinary Surgeons Board as their veterinary hospital inspector and  complaints officer. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </h4>
           	  <h4> During  my  time working  as a veterinary surgeon I pursued other interests  including wildlife management, environmental studies,  and  working with both the Australian Veterinary Association and  Wingecarribee Shire Council.  I have  also  taught Environmental Studies for NSW TAFE including doing bushwalking excursions. </h4>
           	  <h4> My interest in local government includes working with Council  and  working for the community in campaigns to  save  prime agricultural land in the Wingecarribee Shire I established one of Australia's first non euthanasia animal shelters in Wingecarribee Shire.  I studied  Natural Resources  at UNE  where I did subjects in Town Planning  and Land Use Management.  My interests in wildlife management led  to  me to realise that to  protect  and manage our wildlife we  need to stop loss of habitat  and  therefore manage urban and commercial developments to minimize damage to wildlife habitat and corridors.  I  was a  founding  member  of WIRES  which  was a pioneer in creating  a statewide  wildlife rescue network. </h4>
           	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
           	  <h2 class="padbot3">Hobbies and Interests </h2>
           	  <h4> I participate actively in cycling, swimming  and triathlons.  My more sedate  interests are  gardening and  renovating,  I have  renovated  four  houses  as an owner builder,  and  created many  gardens  with  an eye to a mix of  native gardens and cottage garden. 
           	    I am a member of the Scenic Rim Tourism Inc, the Scenic Rim Cycling Group, BOSS, Scenic Rim Ratepayers Association, and the Botanical Gardens. I &nbsp;am a keen bushwalker and &nbsp;bird enthusiast,  and enjoy &nbsp;travelling to interesting destinations.</h4>
